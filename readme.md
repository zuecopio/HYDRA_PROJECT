# Order Preparation in a Warehouse (Robotic Automation Project)

---

## Project context

Second year of degree and we are faced with a new challenge in the subject of RII Project 2: Development and Programming. The challenge consists, as in the previous year, in making a realistic automation proposal.

<br>

The proposed project is located in a warehouse of technological devices which aims to automate the process of order preparation for a certain section.

<br>

## The proposal

Automation optimizes the assembly and transport of boxes, improving efficiency and reducing the physical effort of workers.

<br>

  - **Selecting and opening boxes:** A collaborative robot assembles and tapes the boxes.
  - **Device Pick & Place** An industrial robot places the devices into the boxes.
  - **Transport of boxes:** The filled boxes are transported to the next stage of the shipping line.
